# 09.-ML-FIFA-PYTHON

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ANALYSE AND REPRESENT THE DATA ABOUT THE PLAYERS STATS ALONG FIFAs 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21.


1. Scatter plots of the best 50 field players with different colors depending on the year of the FIFA (fifa15 -> red , fifa18 -> yellow , fifa21 -> blue),
with skill variables (pace , shooting , passing , dribbling , defending , physic)

2. Represent with plot/s how the age of the 100 best players has been changing through the years.

3. What are the most used team_jersey_number's among the 100 best players and the 100 worst players. And finally among all the players.

4. What are the most common team_position's among the 100 best players and the 100 worst players. And finally among all the players.

5. Represent the variables (age , height_cm , weight_kg) for the best 50 field players.

6. Regression about how the variables (29) (attacking_crossing , attacking_finishing , attacking_heading_accuracy , attacking_short_passing , attacking_volleys ,
					skill_dribbling , skill_curve , skill_fk_accuracy , skill_long_passing , skill_ball_control ,
					movement_acceleration , movement_sprint_speed , movement_agility , movement_reactions , movement_balance ,
					power_shot_power , power_jumping , power_stamina , power_strength , power_long_shots ,
					mentality_agression , mentality_interceptions , mentality_positioning , mentality_vision , mentality_penalties , mentality_composure ,
					defending_marking *(it looks like some values are missing) , defending_standing_tackle , defending_sliding_tackle)
	affect the global score. Use all players as observations.
  
  
  *OBSERVATIONS*
  Exercise 6 is divided in many chunks just to try and check different algorithms, trainsets, testsets and predictions.
  This project is just for the sake of learning and training my Data Science, Machine Learning, plots, graphs and Python programming skills.
